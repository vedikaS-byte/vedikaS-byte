# Welcome To My Repository! 
I am currently a Master of Environmental Data Science (MEDS) student at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management, UC Santa Barbara. I am passionate about utilizing data science to help clients understand their emissions, as well as develop reductions strategies.
 
 **I will be developing my GitHub throughout the year as I work towards my Master of Environmental Data Science. Apologies for the messiness!**
